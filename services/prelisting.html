                <center><h3>Prelisting Appraisals</h3></center>
                <p>Anyone who is looking to list their home for sale should get an independent, unbiased, certified appraisal.</p>
                <p>Online sites such as Zillow can be very inaccurate and unreliable. Brokers often have their own agenda and can’t be trusted while at the same time aren’t qualified to give fair market value anyway.</p>
                
                <p>We will appraise your property having your interests in mind with no bias. We aren’t affiliated with any realty group so you know you will get a neutral fair market value. With this knowledge you can then make an informed decision.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>                
                <p><h4><b>The appraisal process includes the following:</b></h4></p>
                <p></p>
                <p><b>*The Appraisal Inspection - </b>The appraiser would come by and do a physical inspection which would include measuring the property to attain an accurate GLA (Gross Living Area), shoot photos of the interior/exterior, do a visual inspection to determine condition and account for any necessary repair or updates.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p><b>*Comparable Sale Selection and Adjustments – </b></h4>The appraiser would do a thorough market analysis of recently sold sales and available listings. 4 Comparable sales would then be chosen which are most similar to the subject. Adjustments would then be made for various discrepancies which include: Square footage, lot size, age, condition, room count (bed & bath), basement, heating/cooling, garage, amenities, location, style, view, obsolescence etc. The appraiser would also analyze recent market trends and determine if the subject is in a declining, stable or increasing market and then make appropriate “time” adjustments.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p><b>*Final Reconciliation – </b>The appraiser would then carefully analyze the pre/post adjusted sales price of the comparables, determine which sale(s) deserve most weight (There are many factors that can determine comparable weight which include: proximity to subject, the most recent sale, similar condition, size, style, net/gross adjustment % etc.) and arrive at an appraised value for the subject property.</p>
    
                <p>A certified appraisal can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be a very valuable negotiating tool once you have a potential buyer.</li>
                    <li>Impress buyer’s with written proof of your home’s condition inside and out.</li>
                    <li>Make yourself aware of problems and eliminate last-minute repair hassles that might delay a closing.</li>
                    <li>Decrease the chances of unknown problems that cause sales to fall through.</li>
                    <li>Eliminate the wait for the buyer or their mortgage company to get the appraisal done on their own.</li>
                </ul>
    
                <p>Many people are surprised when they find out that the market value of their home is much more than they thought, so investing in a professional appraisal actually allowed these people to receive several thousand more dollars than they thought they would when their home was sold. Others have an inflated opinion of their home’s value and an appraisal helped them to realistically price their home in order for it to sell. An overpriced home will not attract buyers, which means no offers and no closing and that you have wasted valuable time, money, and efforts.</p>
                <p></p>
                <h4><b>Improvements to add value</b></h4>
    
                <p>In addition to “how much?” there may be other important questions to ask yourself before listing your home. Questions like ”Would it be better to paint the entire house before we sell it?”, ”Should I put in that third bathroom?”, ”Should I complete my kitchen remodel?” Many things which we do to our houses have an effect on their value. Unfortunately, not all of them have an equal effect. While a kitchen remodel may improve the appeal of a home, it may not add nearly enough to the value to justify the expense.</p>
                <p>We can step in and help make these decisions. Unlike a real estate agent, an appraiser has no vested interest in what amount the house sells for. Our appraisal fees are based on efforts to complete the report and not a percentage of the sales price. So a professional appraisal can often help homeowners make the best decisions on investing in their homes and setting a fair sales price.</p>
                <p></p>
